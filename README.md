## 🔐 Admin Access

**Default Credentials:**
- **Username:** `admin`
- **Password:** `password123`

⚠️ **Change these credentials in production!**

Edit `app.py` line with:
```python
if username == 'your_username' and password == 'your_secure_password':
```

Or use environment variables:
```python
import os
ADMIN_USER = os.getenv('ADMIN_USER', 'admin')
ADMIN_PASS = os.getenv('ADMIN_PASS', 'password123')

## 🔧 Configuration

### Change Timezone
Edit `app.py`:
```python
def format_time(timestamp_str):
    # For India (IST): UTC+5:30
    your_timezone = timezone(timedelta(hours=5, minutes=30))
    
    # Other options:
    # UTC: timezone(timedelta(hours=0))
    # US EST: timezone(timedelta(hours=-5))
    # Singapore: timezone(timedelta(hours=8))
    # UK: timezone(timedelta(hours=1))
```

### Change Model Accuracy Thresholds
Edit `dashboard.html` & `retrain_logs.html`:
```html
{% if log['accuracy'] >= 95 %}
  <span class="badge success">✓ Excellent</span>
{% elif log['accuracy'] >= 90 %}
  <span class="badge success">✓ Good</span>
```

## 📊 How Predictions Work

1. **Input:** User submits job description
2. **Validation:** Check minimum words & alphabetic content
3. **Vectorization:** Convert text to TF-IDF numerical features
4. **Prediction:** Logistic Regression classifier outputs probability
5. **Classification:** Apply threshold (0.5) to determine Fake/Real
6. **Storage:** Save to SQLite with timestamp & confidence
7. **Output:** Display result with confidence % to user

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'joblib'` | Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` |
| Model files missing | Run `python fake_job_pipeline.py` first |
| Database errors | Delete `job_predictions.db` and restart app |
| Wrong time display | Update timezone in `format_time()` function |
| Login redirects to wrong page | Clear browser cache/cookies |
| Charts not showing | Check browser console for JS errors |
| Unicode errors on Windows | Save all files as UTF-8 |

## 🙋 FAQ

**Q: Can I use my own training data?**
A: Yes! Modify `fake_job_pipeline.py` to load your CSV/dataset instead of hardcoded samples.

**Q: How accurate is the model?**
A: Depends on training data quality. Current model achieves ~93-97% accuracy (see dashboard).

**Q: Can I change the prediction threshold?**
A: Yes, edit `app.py` in the `/predict` route:
```python
label = "Fake Job" if prob > 0.6 else "Real Job"  # Change from 0.5
```

**Q: Is this production-ready?**
A: It's a great foundation! Add security hardening before real deployment.

**Q: How do I add more features?**
A: Modify `fake_job_pipeline.py` to include additional text features, then retrain.
